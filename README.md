# Tetris Game
Welcome to the Tetris Game project! This Python application provides a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game. With the Tetris Game, users can enjoy the timeless challenge of fitting falling blocks together to create complete rows and clear them from the board.

## Features
1. **Classic Gameplay:** Offers the classic gameplay of Tetris, where players control falling blocks called Tetriminos to create complete rows and clear them from the board.

2. **Block Movement:** Allows the player to move Tetriminos left or right and rotate them to fit into available spaces on the game board.

3. **Line Clearing:** Clears completed rows from the board when they are filled with blocks, allowing the player to continue playing and earn points.

4. **Scoring:** Tracks and displays the player's score based on the number of rows cleared and the level of play.

5. **Level Up:** Increases the game speed and difficulty as the player clears more rows and progresses through levels.

6. **Game Over:** Ends the game when the stack of Tetriminos reaches the top of the game board, displaying a game over screen and allowing the player to restart the game.
